# This file contains configuration for each of the environments in which
# ci-admin/ci-configuration apply.
#
# Structure
# ---------
#
# Each environment, keyed by its name, must have a rootUrl.  The credentials
# are checked against that rootUrl to ensure that it is being applied in the
# right place.
#
# Each environment can also have `modify_resources`, a list of modifications to
# make to the generated resources.  Such modifications are defined in ci-admin,
# and exist to help configure minor differences between environments, such as
# to prevent a staging environment from carrying a full production workload.
