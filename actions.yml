# This file defines in-tree actions, the roles that have access to them, the
# schema they accept, and the levels and trust-domains for which they exist.
#
# NOTE: the format of this file is not yet finalized and may change
#
# This file is a list of actions, each identified by trust_domain, level, and
# action_perm. An action_perm is either "generic", which includes all actions
# that do not require special scopes and which can be triggered by all users
# at the given scm level; or the name of the action for anything else.
#
# The `groups` property defines the LDAP groups which have access to trigger
# the action.
